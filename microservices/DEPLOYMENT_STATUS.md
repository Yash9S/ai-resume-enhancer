# 🚀 Microservices Deployment Status

## ✅ Successfully Deployed Services

### 1. **AI Extraction Service** (Python FastAPI)
- **URL**: http://localhost:8001 (direct) | http://localhost:8080/ai/v1/ (via gateway)
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy
- **Purpose**: AI-powered resume parsing and enhancement
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - Health: `/health`
  - AI Providers: `/ai-providers` 
  - Text Extraction: `/extract/text`
  - Structured Extraction: `/extract/structured`
  - Resume Enhancement: `/enhance`
  - Metrics: `/metrics`

### 2. **API Gateway** (Nginx)
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy
- **Purpose**: Request routing, load balancing, CORS handling
- **Routes**:
  - Health: `/health`
  - AI Service: `/ai/v1/*` → `ai-extraction-service:8001`
  - Rails App: `/*` → `your existing Rails app with React-Rails`

### 3. **Business Logic + Frontend** (Your Existing Rails App with React-Rails)
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000 (your existing Rails app)
- **Status**: ⏳ Ready to integrate
- **Purpose**: Business logic, user management, React UI
- **Features**: 
  - Devise authentication ✅
  - React-Rails integration ✅  
  - Resume management models ✅
  - Ready to call AI service ⏳

### 4. **PostgreSQL Database**
- **URL**: localhost:5433
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy
- **Purpose**: Persistent data storage
- **Database**: ai_resume_parser_microservices

### 5. **Redis Cache**
- **URL**: localhost:6380
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy
- **Purpose**: Caching and job queues

## 🎯 Architecture Achievement

✅ **Separation of Concerns**: AI extraction logic completely separated from business logic
✅ **Independent Scaling**: Each service can scale independently
✅ **Technology Flexibility**: Python for AI, Rails for business logic, React for frontend
✅ **Port Conflict Resolution**: All services running on non-conflicting ports
✅ **Health Monitoring**: All services have health check endpoints
✅ **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and CORS handling

## 📊 Service Communication Test Results
